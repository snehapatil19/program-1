<p>The word “Dharwad” means a place of rest in a long travel or a small habitation. For centuries, Dharwad acted as a gateway between 
the Malenaadu (western mountains) and the Bayalu seeme (plains) and it became a resting place for travellers.
The name is derived from the Sanskrit word ‘dwarawata’, ‘dwara’ meaning “door” and ‘wata’ or ‘wada’ meaning “town”.</p></center>
